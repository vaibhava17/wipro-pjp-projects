EMP table has composite primary key EMPNO,DEPTNO.The non-key attribute is LOC.In this case LOC only depends on DEPTNO, which is a part of  primary key.

So,To bring table in 2NF , we need to break the table into two parts where the following conditions should follow:

-->First realtion in 1NF.

-->No partial dependency in the relation.

As followed:-

1) EMP Table: EMPNO,ENAME,SAL,DEPTNO
2) DEPT TABLE: DEPTNO,DNAME,LOC
