The given STUDENT Table is in 2NF before proceeding to 3NF.
The other condition is that, there should be no transitive dependency of non-prime  attribute.
So ROLLNO determines EXAM,EXAM determines MARKS.
This implies we have functional dependeny,and this structure does not  satisfy the 3NF.


In order to achieve 3NF,we need to divide table as followed:

TABLE1 ---> ROLLNO,NAME,AGE,EXAM
TABLE2 ---> EXAM,MARKS,GRADE
