VII)
i)Create a new database target table, for example, say “sum_emp_deptwise”, using the below script. You will see the new database target table is created under Target folder in next step.
ii)reate a New mapping “m_ sum_emp_deptwise”.

In order to create new mapping, we need source table (EMP) and target table (sum_sal_deptwise) both in mapping designer for that we need to

Import the target table “sum_emp_deptwise” in the mapping.
Import the source table “emp”.
iii)From the Source Qualifier, delete the columns empno, ename, job, mgr, hiredate & comm so leaving only the columns deptno and sal.
Create a new aggregator transformation using the toolbox menu as shown in screen shot. When you click on the aggregator icon, a new aggregator transformation will be created.
iv) Drag and drop SAL & DEPTNO columns from source qualifier (SQ_EMP) to the aggregator transformation
v)double click on aggregator transformation to open its properties 
a)Add a new port in the transformation
b)Rename the port name to SUM_emp
c)Change the data type of this new port to double
d)Make this port as output port by selecting the checkbox of the output port.
e)Click on the expression option
v)Add expression- sum(EMP), you have to write this expression.
Select Ok Button, this will bring back the edit transformation window.
vi)edit transformation window, select option “GroupBy” by marking the check box against the deptno column and Click Ok ( by selecting group by against the deptno, we are instructing Informatica to group salaries by deptno)
vii)Link the deptno and sum_emp columns from aggregator transformation to the target table
